# ISLR_solutions
I worked (nearly) all the exercises in __An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R__. Here they are, in PDF form.

The code and comments here are my own work. In a few places, especially when I got an answer that seemed strange, I consulted the solutions provided at https://github.com/asadoughi/stat-learning/ -- these places are clearly noted in my writing. I usually ended up agreeing with @asadoughi, but not always. I hope other learners will benefit from having a (nearly) full set of proposed solutions to compare with their own work.

I used the 4th printing of the paper book, and I recall finding at least one typo that was corrected in later errata. The authors generously provide the most recent revision at their website, http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ .
